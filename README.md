# hackathon_finalsubmission

Hello Judges! this is the team leader of the team "Coding Trio" Vaibhav Bhardwaj. Despite the name, this was a solo/individual project due to my teammates facing a technical problem.

A little something about my project:
-- My project is focused on creating a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) that is working well with decent accuracy. However, the main problem with the "hometheftdetectionAI.ipynb" is that a large part of the dataset is missing, therefore I was unable to properly add functionality to the A.I. I also, was unable to implement planned libraries like YOLO for object detection, and CV2 for real-world A.I recognition.

Due to a lot of functionality missing, I've also provided a small and rough model of an A.I to show that this project was indeed something that gained a lot of progress. The file "example_neuralAI.py" should run independently, and you should be able to create your own model of A.I via Tensorflow, or load your own version of Tf AI.

I have also provided a sample *TRAINED* A.I in the folder "modelAI" if you wish to load an A.I model. The reason I kept it's epoch low and it's confidence level being more variable, is because I chose not to overfit the model. As in the real world, the A.I will face things that isn't from it's dataset.

I hope you like my project,
Have a great day,
Vaibhav Bhardwaj.
